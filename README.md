# Location-Based-Matchmaker
  
Demo Video coming soon  
  
This project uses Firebase Realtime Database to match you with other users within a ~150 meter radius. If you are not in close proximity of another user no matches will be made with other users at that given moment, but if someone enters the radius a match will be made.  
  
The application also has a fully-functioning login/authentication system that requires verification via an email such that the application cannot be used without an account.

Files corresponding to the workspace are not included in this repository. The GoogleService-Info.plist file was also omitted to prevent access to the Firebase Database, but the application can be easily replicated by simply using your own GoogleService-Info.plist file from Firebase.
